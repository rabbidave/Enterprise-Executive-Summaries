# **AI Security & Data Observability @ PayPal**

1. **Emerging Regulatory & Legal Exposure**: Navigating complex mandates like the EU AI Act and WH Executive Orders.
2. **Novel Attack Vectors & State-Backed Actors**: State-backed actors targeting market leaders, "unpatchable" GenAI vulnerabilities, AI backdoors, and sophisticated data/IP exfiltration methods like training data extraction or application decompilation.
3. **Brand x Reputational & Trust Impact**: Mitigating risks from hallucinations, biased outputs, and other negative customer experiences.

#### **Ubiquitous & Safe AI via Per-Integration AI Passports & ‚ÄòGFCI‚Äô Plugs** üõÇüè°üìäüîå

By embedding robust AI security and observability into every AI deployment at PayPal ‚Äì we create an "AI Passport" and a "GFCI plug" for each integration. This will be achieved through a horizontal strategy focused on these goals:

1Ô∏è‚É£ - **AI-Native API Auth via Metadata-driven MCP handshake w/ graduated controls** e.g. Hashed Nonce, PKI, Regex x AST

2Ô∏è‚É£ - **'Data Classification as a Service' via SDK & CI/CD** e.g. `classify.py`

3Ô∏è‚É£ - **Auto-SLA via Metadata-driven ‚ÄòRight-Sizing' & Refinement** e.g. ABx(n)Judge(s)

4Ô∏è‚É£ - **System-Level Identity & Auth via OOT Init Breadcrumb** (e.g. n-Granularity JSON-hash(s) for verification & provenance).

Continuing to invest in the teams and technology required allows us to develop net-new microservices like `classify.py`

- Data Classification & (local-first) Monitoring Service' as API and SDK integration

This work should be understood as a horizontal need across the enterprise.
